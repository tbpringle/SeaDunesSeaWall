1. I didn’t notice a schedule in the contract. We should likely try to tie them to a contractual duration in some way.
2. The scope doesn’t mention storage and protection of materials
3. Might want to mention safety per OSHA requirements
4. The scope should include anything they need to do to gain access to the beach for materials and equipment
5. Should we require them to put up temporary orange fencing, barricades, or signage to keep the general public away from the work area.
6. I’m not sure if we will encounter coquina or rock, but does it need a mention if we encounter it?
7. They need to include all hoisting, lifting, cranes, lulls, forklifts, trucking, and equipment necessary to execute the project
8. Do they include the costs for the city permits?
9. Should we mention anything about if a hurricane is on the way during construction. Will they remove materials, protect the in progress construction, etc.
